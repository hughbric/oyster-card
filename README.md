- Clone or fork it: `https://github.com/hughbric/oystercard`
- In your terminal, `cd` into the project root folder.
- `bundle` to install all dependencies.
- Run `irb`
- Enter the following commands:
  - `require './lib/oystercard.rb'`
  - `card = Oystrcard.new`

 This will initialize a new instance of the oystercard class.
 To top-up your oystercard with an amount and then check the balance:
   - `card.top_up(30)`
   - `card.balance`
